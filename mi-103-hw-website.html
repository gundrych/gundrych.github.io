        <h1>I'm not Sure What to Write Here</h1>
        <p>I don't know what I should be writing under these headers, so I'm mostly typing for filler. Since I don't know what to put here, I'll just write what I did this morning. I woke up and lied in bed for a while because I was lazy. Then I went to the dining hall to get breakfast, but the only thing they had that I wanted was scrambled eggs, so that's what I ate. Afterwards I went to my first class and almost fell asleep because I go to bed late. Not too bad. Anyway this text is about the right size now, so bye!</p><br>
